#### Code Standards

**C# Conventions:**
- Follow Unity's C# coding standards
- Use PascalCase for public methods and properties
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and under 50 lines when possible

**Unity Specific:**
- Use `[SerializeField]` for inspector-visible private fields
- Implement proper cleanup in `OnDisable()`/`OnDestroy()`
- Use coroutines for async operations
- Handle null references gracefully

**WebRTC & Networking:**
- Always check connection state before sending data
- Implement proper error handling for network failures
- Log connection events for debugging
- Handle graceful reconnection

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Test thoroughly on Quest hardware
   - Follow existing code patterns

3. **Test Requirements**
   - Verify functionality on actual Quest 3/3S device
   - Test with both Mirage and Lucy AI models
   - Test with different network conditions
   - Ensure no regression in existing features
   - Check memory usage doesn't increase significantly

4. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference related issues with `#issue-number`
   - Keep commits atomic and focused

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Include testing performed
   - Link to related issues
   - Add screenshots/videos if UI changes

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Required Testing

- **Hardware Testing**: Must test on actual Quest hardware
- **Model Testing**: Test with both Mirage and Lucy models to ensure compatibility
