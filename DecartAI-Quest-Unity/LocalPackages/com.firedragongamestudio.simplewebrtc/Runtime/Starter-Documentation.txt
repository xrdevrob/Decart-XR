4. A tutorial/explanation YouTube video can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1F_cqfdU6o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1F_cqfdU6o)

### WebRTC Web Client
1. Make sure your WebSocket signaling server is reachable, up and running.
2. Checkout the [SimpleWebRTC Web Client](https://github.com/FireDragonGameStudio/SimpleWebRTC-Web)
3. Run `npm install` in the web client directory, to get everything ready
4. Start the web client either locally (`npm run dev` or `npx vite`) or deploy it to a webspace
5. (Optional) Start your Unity application and make sure the WebRTC logic is up and running.
6. Connect all clients to your WebSocket signaling server and wait until the signaling procedure is completed.
7. Stream your video, audio and/or data to every connected client.

### Support for Unity Visual Scripting

1. Make sure [Unity Visual Scripting](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualscripting@latest) package is imported.
2. Import SimpleWebRTC Visual Scripting samples, via Unity Package Manager.
3. Regenerate Nodes under Edit/Project Settings/Visual Scripting.
4. Mind to add the WebRTCConnectionVisualScriptingEvents component to your WebRTCConnection GameObject.
5. Add your WebRTCConnection GameObject to the scene variables of your graph - look at the sample scene for an example.

### Public Properties
| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `IsWebSocketConnected` | `bool` | Indicates whether the WebSocket connection is active. |
| `ConnectionToWebSocketInProgress` | `bool` | Indicates whether a connection attempt is in progress. |
| `IsWebRTCActive` | `bool` | Shows if a WebRTC session is active. |
| `IsVideoTransmissionActive` | `bool` | Indicates whether video transmission is active. |
| `IsAudioTransmissionActive` | `bool` | Indicates whether audio transmission is active. |

### Public Methods

| `WebRTCConnected` | Invoked when a WebRTC connection is successfully established. |
| `DataChannelConnected` | Raised when the data channel connection is established. |
| `DataChannelMessageReceived` | Fired when a message is received via the data channel. |
| `VideoTransmissionReceived` | Triggered when a video stream is received. |
| `AudioTransmissionReceived` | Triggered when an audio stream is received. |

### Configuration
The `WebRTCConnection` component includes several configurable parameters:
```csharp
[SerializeField] private string WebSocketServerAddress = "wss://unity-webrtc-signaling.glitch.me";
[SerializeField] private string StunServerAddress = "stun:stun.l.google.com:19302";
[SerializeField] private string LocalPeerId = "PeerId"; // must be unique for each peer
[SerializeField] private bool UseHTTPHeader = true; // used for e.g. Glitch.com, because headers are needed
[SerializeField] private bool ShowLogs = true; // mostly for debugging purposes, can be disabled
[SerializeField] private bool ShowDataChannelLogs = true; // mostly for debugging purposes, can be disabled
```

Modify these values in the Unity Inspector or directly in the script.

## Example
Following sample scenes are included in the package (available at Samples tab in package manager):
* *WebSocket-TestConnection*: For testing the wecksocket connection separately.
* *WebRTC-SingleClient-STUNConnection*: Testing STUN connection for a single client. Works standalone and can be deployed to clients. Make sure to set the `LocalPeerId` for each client individually.
* *WebRTC-SingleClient-wLobby-STUNConnection*: A simple Lobby example for handling multiple STUN WebRTC clients. `SimpleLobbyManager.cs` shows an example, how to use **SimpleWebRTC** via C#.
* *WebRTC-MultipleClients-STUNConnection*: Shows how multiple clients can be connected via peer-to-peer connections and share data, video and audio transmissions.
* *WebRTC-SingleClient-STUNConnection-PhotonFusion*: Testing STUN connection for a single client using Photon Fusion 2 as signaling server. Works standalone and can be deployed to clients. Make sure to set the `LocalPeerId` for each client individually.
* *WebRTC-SingleClient-STUNConnection-VisualScripting*: Using Unity Visual Scripting with SimpleWebRTC. Works with all SimpleWebRTC features and can be deployed to clients.
* *WebRTC-SingleClient-STUNConnection-ImmersiveSpectator-Sender*: A simple example for a possible video sender, which can be every 3D application.
* *WebRTC-SingleClient-STUNConnection-ImmersiveSpectator-Receiver*: The receiver sample for the video sender. This will most likely targeted at an XR device.

## Example code
```csharp
WebRTCConnection connection = gameObject.GetComponent<WebRTCConnection>();
connection.Connect(); // Establish WebSocket connection

// after a WebRTC peer-to-peer connection is established
connection.StartVideoTransmission(); // Begin video streaming
connection.SendDataChannelMessage("Hello Peer!"); // Send a message over the data channel
```
